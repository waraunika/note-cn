# 1.1 Computer Network & Uses
## Concept
- definition: Computer network is defined as an interconnected collection of autonomous computers that are capable of exchanging information and resources with one another
- Fundamental requirement is that the computers must be able to communicate and share data
- This interconnection is facilitated through various transmission media, including:
	- guided media: copper wires, fibre optics
	- unguided media: microwaves, infrared waves and communication satellites.
- network enables computers to function not as isolated systems but as a cohesive, integrated unit
## Advantages
1. Resource sharing: 
	- primary advantage
	- allows multiple users to share expensive hardware devices such as printers, plotters and scanners
	- enables the centralised storage and sharing of data and software applications
	- eliminates duplication and ensures consistency
2. Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:
	- Networks provide a powerful and rapid communication medium.
	- They facilitate the exchange of information via email, instant messaging and video conferencing
	- they enable collaboration among individuals, and teams, regardless of their physical location
3. Improved Reliability and Data Integrity: 
	- Networks allow for data redundancy through centralised backup systems on network servers.
	- if one system fails, data can be recovered from another location, improving reliability.
	- centralised data management also reduces the risk of inconsistent or duplicated information
4. Cost Efficiency
	- by sharing resources and infrastructure, organisations can avoid redundant purchases of hardware and software, leading to substantial cost savings
	- networks also reduce communication costs by leveraging internal systems and internet-based communication over traditional methods
5. Centralised Management and Security:
	- System administrators can manage software developments, updates and security policies from a central server for all connected computers.
	- this simplifies network administration, ensures uniformity, and allows for the implementation of robust, centralised security measures like firewalls and access control
6. Scalability and Flexibility:
	- Networks can be easily scaled by adding new computers and devices without significant overhead and disruption to existing services
	- allows an organisation to grow it computing capacity incrementally as needed
## Applications
1. **Business applications**
	- Resource and Infrastructure Sharing: Networking allows for the sharing of expensive hardware resource like high-speed printers, large-capacity storage arrays and powerful servers across an entire organisation, leading to significant cost savings
	- Enterprise Communication Systems: Networks provide the backbone for powerful communication tools such as email, instant messaging for quick collaboration, video conferencing for remote meetings and shared online documentation
	- E-Business and E-Commerce: Manufacturers and businesses use networks (primarily the internet) for electronic procurement from suppliers (E-business) and for direct selling of products and services to consumers over the internet (E-commerce)
2. **Home applications**
	1. Access to Remote Information: This includes browsing world-wide news platforms, accessing online libraries and databases, and using search engines for a multitude of purposes, reducing reliance on physical media
	2. Person-to-Person Communication: Networks host a multitude of connection channels, including social media platforms, instant messaging applications, online chat rooms and voice/video over VoIP services
	3. Entertainment: This is a major driver, encompassing video-on-demand services, online gaming, streaming music and podcasts and digital media distribution
	4. Home E-Commerce and Finance: This involves online shopping through vast digital catalogues, electronic banking for managing accounts and paying bills and handling personal investments through online brokerages
3. **Mobile applications**
	- Portable and Ubiquitous Access: mobile networks allow users with devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops to access the internet, corporate data and communication services from virtually anywhere, enabling a "always-connected" lifestyle
	- Location-based services: Networks enable applications like GPS Navigation, finding nearby services (restaurants, fuel stations), and receiving location-specific alerts and information
## Part of Life
1. Digital Financial Transactions and Management
	- Networks are the foundation of modern finance
	- everytime an individual also uses online banking to transfer funds, pay utility bills or manage their investment portfolio through a trading app, they are leveraging a secure computer network
	- point-of-sale (POS) terminals in retail stores use networks to verify debit/credit card transactions in real-time with banking servers.
	- the entire digital payment ecosystem, including services like mobile wallets and UPI, operates over complex, secure networks
2. On-Demand Entertainment and Media Consumption
	- The paradigm of entertainment has shifted entirely to network-based delivery
	- streaming services for movies and series, music platforms, and online gaming are all facilitated by high-speed computer networks.
	- provides instant, on-demand access to a vast global library of content, eliminating the need for physical media like DVDs or CDs and allowing for personalised entertainment experiences
3. Ubiquitous Personal and Professional Communication
	- Networks are the central nervous system of modern communication
	- daily activities such as sending and receiving mails, using instant messaging applications for personal and group chats, and participating in video conference calls for work or family (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams) are all network-dependent.
	- Social media platforms, which are entirely hosted on massive global networks, have redefined social interaction and information dissemination
4. E-Commerce and the Digital Marketplace
	- entire process of online shopping is a manifestation of computer networks.
	- from browsing extensive digital catalogues on e-commerce websites, comparing prices across different vendors, reading user reviews, and making secure electronic payments, to tracking the shipment of the order through logistics networks
	- every single step relies on seamless integration of multiple computer networks to function efficiently and provide a seamless consumer experience
5. Civic Services, Information and Education
	- public life is increasingly managed through networks
	- accessing government services and information portals
	- using gps and online maps for navigation
	- proliferation of online learning platforms and distance education programs are all prime examples.
	- even routine activities like checking the weather forecast on smartphone app involve fetching data from remote servers over a network, demonstrating how deeply networks are embedded in daily decision-making and access to public utilities.
# 1.2 Networking model: C/S, P2P, active network
## Client Server Model
- the data are stored on powerful computers called servers, often centrally housed and maintained by a system administrator
- the data accessors have simpler machines, called clients on their disks
- the client and server machines are connected by a network
- the whole arrangement is collectively called client-server model
- applicable when client and server are at any distance apart
- two processes are involved: one on client machine, one on server machine:
	- communication takes the form of client process sending a message over the network to the server process
	- the client process then waits for a reply message
	- when server process gets the request and accepts it
	- it performs the required work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply
## Peer-to-peer Model
- individuals who form a loose group can communicate with others in the group
- every person in principle can communicate with one or more other people;
- there is no fixed division into client and server
- is created when two or more PCs or devices are connected and share their resources without communicating to a central system
- each peer has equal capabilities and responsibility
## Differences of CS/P2P model

| Attribtue    | Client-Server       | Peer-to-Peer |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
| setup        | difficult to set up | easy         |
| installation |                     |              |
